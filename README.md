✏ *Creating a seconds-counter component that displays how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading. Inspired in ***./preview.gif****.

## Goals 👽

- The user can create an alert to be notified when the counter reaches the specified seconds.

## Preview 🎬

* If you can't start the server, run the following command: `$ npm install`
