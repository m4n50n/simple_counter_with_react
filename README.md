# ![4Geeks Logo](http://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16) Simple Counter with React

✏ *Creating a seconds-counter component, called SecondsCounter. Inspired in ***./preview.gif****.

## Instructions 📄
* The whole purpose of the component is to display how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad).
* Use the ReactDOM.render() to render the component into the web-app.
* Use the setInterval() function to re-render the component on every second.
* The component does not need a local state, you can pass the number of seconds as props like this:
<SecondsCounter seconds={3434} />
You can find the clock icon on the left of the component in Font Awesome.
* Create an option to countdown from a given number.
* Create stop, reset, and resume functionality
* Create an alert when the user reaches a specified time, ie the user enters "10", an alert should render notifying the user that their time was reached

## Preview 🎬
* You can open this repository in **Gitpod**.
* Start the webpack server with live reload running the next command: `$ npm run start`
* If you can't start the server, run the following command: `$ npm install`
